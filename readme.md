# Stickario

This project started as a joint coding project with my youngest son.  I wanted to expand our simple game engine to allow for a 2d side scrolling platformer.

The project uses C# and a WinForms shell.  This project has an updated game engine (with more refactoring than [shootmup](https://github.com/speedyjeff/shootmup))
